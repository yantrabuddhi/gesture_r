Here are the sample code for GestureR:

The sample codes are in the format of Arduino

Each Type of GestureR has two folders of sample code:
GestureR_XXXXX_Gesture - Sample code for using gesture sensing part of sensor
GestureR_XXXXX_Light - Sample code for using ambient light sensing part of sensor

User may use both parts of sensor simultaneously if combining both folder


For GestureR TINY, please use
GestureR_BREAD_TINY_XXXXX

For GestureR BREAD, please use
GestureR_BREAD_TINY_XXXXX

For GestureR SHIELD, please use
GestureR_SHIELD_XXXXX

For GestureR SHIELD ULTRA, please use
GestureR_ULTRA_XXXXX

P.S.
For GestureR SHIELD ULTRA, user may copy folder [PCA9685] to folder [librraries] of Arduino to get the support of led driver PCA9685
